    "## ‚ùì FAQ\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Usage & Compatibility**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: What dataset sizes work best with TabPFN?**\n",
    "A: TabPFN is optimized for **datasets up to 10,000 rows**. For larger datasets, consider using **Random Forest preprocessing** or other extensions. See our [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/154SoIzNW1LHBWyrxNwmBqtFAr1uZRZ6a#scrollTo=OwaXfEIWlhC8) for strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Why can't I use TabPFN with Python 3.8?**\n",
    "A: TabPFN v2 requires **Python 3.9+** due to newer language features. Compatible versions: **3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Installation & Setup**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I use TabPFN without an internet connection?**\n",
    "\n",
    "TabPFN automatically downloads model weights when first used. For offline usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Using the Provided Download Script**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have the TabPFN repository, you can use the included script to download all models (including ensemble variants):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# After installing TabPFN\n",
    "python scripts/download_all_models.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This script will download the main classifier and regressor models, as well as all ensemble variant models to your system's default cache directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Manual Download**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download the model files manually from HuggingFace:\n",
    "   - Classifier: [tabpfn-v2-classifier-finetuned-zk73skhh.ckpt](https://huggingface.co/Prior-Labs/TabPFN-v2-clf/resolve/main/tabpfn-v2-classifier-finetuned-zk73skhh.ckpt)\n",
    "   - Regressor: [tabpfn-v2-regressor.ckpt](https://huggingface.co/Prior-Labs/TabPFN-v2-reg/resolve/main/tabpfn-v2-regressor.ckpt)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Place the file in one of these locations:\n",
    "   - Specify directly: `TabPFNClassifier(model_path=\"/path/to/model.ckpt\")`\n",
    "   - Set environment variable: `export TABPFN_MODEL_CACHE_DIR=\"/path/to/dir\"` (see environment variables FAQ below)\n",
    "   - Default OS cache directory:\n",
    "     - Windows: `%APPDATA%\\tabpfn\\`\n",
    "     - macOS: `~/Library/Caches/tabpfn/`\n",
    "     - Linux: `~/.cache/tabpfn/`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: I'm getting a `pickle` error when loading the model. What should I do?**\n",
    "A: Try the following:\n",
    "- Download the newest version of tabpfn `pip install tabpfn --upgrade`\n",
    "- Ensure model files downloaded correctly (re-download if needed)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: What environment variables can I use to configure TabPFN?**\n",
    "A: TabPFN uses Pydantic settings for configuration, supporting environment variables and `.env` files:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Configuration:**\n",
    "- `TABPFN_MODEL_CACHE_DIR`: Custom directory for caching downloaded TabPFN models (default: platform-specific user cache directory)\n",
    "- `TABPFN_ALLOW_CPU_LARGE_DATASET`: Allow running TabPFN on CPU with large datasets (>1000 samples). Set to `true` to override the CPU limitation. Note: This will be very slow!\n",
    "\n",
    "**PyTorch Settings:**\n",
    "- `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF`: PyTorch CUDA memory allocation configuration to optimize GPU memory usage (default: `max_split_size_mb:512`). See [PyTorch CUDA documentation](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/cuda.html#optimizing-memory-usage-with-pytorch-cuda-alloc-conf) for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "export TABPFN_MODEL_CACHE_DIR=\"/path/to/models\"\n",
    "export TABPFN_ALLOW_CPU_LARGE_DATASET=true\n",
    "export PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=\"max_split_size_mb:512\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or simply set them in your `.env`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I save and load a trained TabPFN model?**\n",
    "A: Use :func:`save_fitted_tabpfn_model` to persist a fitted estimator and reload\n",
    "it later with :func:`load_fitted_tabpfn_model` (or the corresponding\n",
    "``load_from_fit_state`` class methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from tabpfn import TabPFNRegressor\n",
    "from tabpfn.model_loading import (\n",
    "    load_fitted_tabpfn_model,\n",
    "    save_fitted_tabpfn_model,\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Train the regressor on GPU\n",
    "reg = TabPFNRegressor(device=\"cuda\")\n",
    "reg.fit(X_train, y_train)\n",
    "save_fitted_tabpfn_model(reg, \"my_reg.tabpfn_fit\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Later or on a CPU-only machine\n",
    "reg_cpu = load_fitted_tabpfn_model(\"my_reg.tabpfn_fit\", device=\"cpu\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To store just the foundation model weights (without a fitted estimator) use\n",
    "``save_tabpfn_model(reg.model_, \"my_tabpfn.ckpt\")``. This merely saves a\n",
    "checkpoint of the pre-trained weights so you can later create and fit a fresh\n",
    "estimator. Reload the checkpoint with ``load_model_criterion_config``.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Performance & Limitations**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Can TabPFN handle missing values?**\n",
    "A: **Yes!**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How can I improve TabPFN‚Äôs performance?**\n",
    "A: Best practices:\n",
    "- Use **AutoTabPFNClassifier** from [TabPFN Extensions](https://github.com/priorlabs/tabpfn-extensions) for post-hoc ensembling\n",
    "- Feature engineering: Add domain-specific features to improve model performance\n",
    "Not effective:\n",
    "  - Adapt feature scaling\n",
    "  - Convert categorical features to numerical values (e.g., one-hot encoding)\n",
    "\n",
    "## üõ†Ô∏è Development\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Setup environment:\n",

    "\n",
    "This project collects **anonymous usage telemetry** by default.\n",

    "- **No code, model inputs, or outputs are ever sent**\n",
    "- **Data is strictly anonymous and cannot be linked to individuals**\n",

    "### What we collect\n",
    "We only collect high-level, non-identifying information such as:\n",
    "- Package version\n",
    "- Python version\n",
    "- How often fit and inference are called, including simple metadata like the dimensionality of the input and the type of task (e.g., classification vs. regression) (:warning: never the data itself)\n",
